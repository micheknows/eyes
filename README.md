# Eye Exercise 

This project uses JavaScript to make a pair of eyes follow the mouse cursor as it moves around the page.

## Description

When the page loads, two eyeballs are centered on the screen. As the mouse moves, the X and Y position of the cursor is tracked and used to update the position of the eyeballs with a transform style. This makes the eyes appear to follow the mouse cursor as it moves around the page.

## How to Run

Simply open the index.html file in a browser. Move your mouse cursor around the page and observe the eyeballs following the cursor.

## Roadmap

Future improvements for this project include:

- Adding eyelid animations that make the eyes blink
- Allowing the eyes to look in different directions independently
- Adding facial features like eyebrows that react to the eye movement
